### Compatibility

## Features

### Independent base rotation
The pendulum head (or base) can be rotated independently without affecting the pendulum arm using the ``main_rotate_ctrl``!

### Hide pendulum parts
``Geometry Visibility`` attributes on ``root_ctrl`` allow hiding specific pendulum parts (such as the head or any section), helping animators focus on one or more aspects at a time.

### Global Scale
The ``Global Scale`` attribute on ``root_ctrl`` scales uniformly the entire rig, preventing issues.
